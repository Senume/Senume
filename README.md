# Hi, I'm Thushit Kumar R

**Designing practical GPT-driven pipelines that extract, validate, and correct data at production scale.**

---

## What I do
- Build production-grade LLM + Vision pipelines for document automation (healthcare & finance)  
- Develop agentic systems to detect & auto-correct extraction failures  
- Research & prototype lightweight encoder–decoder models and biosignal (ECG) solutions

---

## Selected highlights
- Designed GPT-based bill extraction (GBT) and prompt-engineering pipelines  
- Implemented logic-driven claim verification & correction (CVC) to reduce manual review  
- Developed DMD-based ECG diagnosis and ECG-based person identification projects
