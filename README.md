# Hi, I'm Thushit Kumar R

**AI • Data Scientist • LLM + Vision-Language Practitioner**

I build practical and cost-efficient AI solutions that work in real business environments — combining model training, fine-tuning, data analysis, and software logic to deliver measurable impact.
My core work is in **LLMs, VLMs, document understanding, and healthcare data / biosignals**.
